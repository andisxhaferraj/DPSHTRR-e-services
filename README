DPSHTRR-e-Services

This project will be about online services offered by “Drejtoria e Pergjithshme e Sherbimeve te Transportit Rrugor”.
Everybody that has an account in this web application will have the opportunity to choose among several services.
After choosing the desired service, a list of required documents will be shown.
The client has to scan these documents and submit them in our web application.
However, for the application to be complete, the client has to pay a certain fee.
This fee can be paid either by bank or by credit Card.
Now, the client has to wait until the employees on the other side check their documents.
If the documents are accurate, then the status of the application will appear as “READY” and the client may go at the “DPSHTRR” office to pick up his service.
Otherwise, the client will be informed about the missing/not accurate documents.

Register -> Choose a Service -> Scan the Documents -> Submit them online -> Pay the Fee -> Wait -> Pick your Service

*Note: This is simply the main idea. Many other features will be implemented on the project.
