The purpose of this software is divided into 2 main parts:
1)	To solve problems the majority of Tirana citizens have by providing automated services from DPSHTRR.
2)	To help the DPSHTRR staff in:
a)	Processing services
b)	Management Part
c)	Communication between sectors.

DPSHTRR e-services is a software which aims to make it easier and less time consuming specific services that “Drejtoria e Përgjithshme e Shërbimit të Transportit Rrugor” offers to Tirana citizens. Everybody that has an account in this web application will have the opportunity to choose among several services. After choosing the desired service, a list of required documents will be shown. The client has to scan these documents and submit them in our web application. However, for the application to be complete, the client has to pay a certain fee. This fee can be paid either by bank or by credit Card. Now, the client has to wait until the employees on the other side check their documents. If the documents are accurate, then the status of the application will appear as “READY” and the client may go at the “DPSHTRR” office to pick up his service. Otherwise, the client will be informed about the missing/not accurate documents. 
Our software will offer a wide specter of services that are provided by DPSHTRR and will select among all services the ones that are appropriate and fulfill all the criteria that is required by DPSHTRR structure and Albanian law. This software will come in help also to the employees of DPSHTRR in the manner of processing, management, communication and organization between different sectors of DPSHTRR. The modules of this software will be divided between sectors, where each sector has its own employees including the manager of that sector and the services that are provided by that specific sector.
The Graphic User Interface will be very easy in terms of usability, for both the citizens and the employees. The software will come in the format of a web application in which technologies like PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, MySQL will be used.

Register -> Choose a Service -> Scan the Documents -> Submit them online -> Pay the Fee -> Wait -> Pick your Service

*Note: This is simply the main idea. Many other features will be implemented on the project.
